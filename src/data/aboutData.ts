    `Hey — I'm Haris. Full-stack dev who turns half-baked ideas into slick, usable websites.`,
    `I love taking rough concepts and shipping them into something people actually want to use.`,
    `I build snappy UIs with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React — stuff that actually feels good to use.`,
    `Animations, micro-interactions, and clean layouts are my jam — they make interfaces feel alive.`,
    `Code should do its job and have personality. I like things that are simple, fast, and kinda fun.`,
    `I favour readable code and small, testable pieces over clever hacks that nobody can maintain.`,
    `I make portfolio sites, landing pages, and tiny interactive bits that help people and brands stand out.`,
    `I focus on clarity and polish so the first impression actually sticks.`,
    `When I'm not coding, you'll find me riffing on design ideas, messing with side projects, or learning new web hacks.`,
    `I play games to unwind — anything from tense strategy matches to chill indie gems.`,
    `Travel's a big one for me: new countries, weird streets, camera in hand — always hunting for a good photo or a fresh idea.`,
    `Cooking simple meals, doing quick workouts at home, and sketching UI ideas on napkins are how I recharge.`,
    `I'm planning to start martial arts soon — it feels like the kind of focus that makes other things sharper.`,
    `Small experiments teach me the quickest tricks — my "lab" is full of half-baked prototypes.`,
    `If you want a dev who cares about visuals and speed (and won't overcomplicate things), I'm your guy.`,
    `I balance design taste with performance — nobody likes a pretty site that loads like molasses.`,
    `Hit me up — collab, chat, or random project ideas are always welcome.`,
